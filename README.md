## Who is this course for?

This course is for anyone who wants to use VS Code as their primary development environment. We keep beginners in mind and help them install the necessary elments (like the correct version of Python and VS Code). But we also think there is a lot to offer experienced Python developers who don't take full advantage of VS Code yet.

All software used in this course is free and open source.
